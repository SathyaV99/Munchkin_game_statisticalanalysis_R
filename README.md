Source for data collection: I have the munchikn board game, I manually inputted each card and using excel I granularized them further to derive 4 additional datasets.

 • Analyzing the probabilities of drawing each card from the respective deck is one way.
 However, to truly understand and predict data accurately, the data should be granular
ized.

 • The game “Munchkin,” for those unfamiliar, is an RPG dungeon-crawling game. I
 chose it to gain a significant advantage in future playthroughs. By predicting or
 understanding the probabilities associated with each card, I can develop better
 tactics and strategies than my opponents
